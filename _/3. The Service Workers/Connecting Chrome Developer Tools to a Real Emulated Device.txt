Connecting Chrome Developer Tools to a Real/ Emulated Device
It's easy to connect your Chrome Developer Tools with a Real or Emulated Android Device (event though the latter unfortunately never worked for me).

The following article explains it step-by-step and by using helpful images: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/

Make sure you enabled "Developer Mode" on your Device! You do that by tapping your Android Build Number (in the Settings) 7 times. Yes, this is no joke ;-)
